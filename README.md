# Hi, my name is mike!
I'm a **horrible** full-stack developer that primarily specializes in Luau.

## 🔭 Languages
* Luau/Lua
* PHP
* C++/C (not good with pointers and memory though, so i'm pretty much useless lol)
* C#
* Python
* Javascript
* HTML5
* CSS

## 🌱 Current Projects
* [BLOXVIVAL (client dev and studio)](https://www.roblox.com/games/12718526123/BLOXVIVAL-Testing-Environment)
* 2Retro4U
* [aurora-core](https://github.com/verify-stack/aurora-core)
* [9n8e/2008E](https://github.com/9n8e/2008E)

## ⚡Focuses
Currently, I'm focusing on Luau and ROBLOX as those are my **primary goals**. Though C++ and PHP (cough cough [9n8e/2008E](https://github.com/9n8e/2008E) cough cough) is my secondary goal as they are widely used across many web/desktop applications.
